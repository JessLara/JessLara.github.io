    <div class="Problem">
      <h1>Problem</h1>
      <p>Online cloud storage demands are increasing on a daily basis with more people accessing the internet and requiring to store their data in a place that’s safe and accessible from anywhere. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Solution">
      <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>ByteSpace will create an organized environment, also known as a space, where you can keep files and content in one quick and easy to access place. ByteSpace is a tool that will allow users to create content quickly; whether that’s a space to keep notes, or a space to share photos, everything is just a click away.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>Cloud and non-cloud storage user are in need of a service that will help them stay organize; they want a place where they can create content, organize their files and where they can collaborate with other users. Current cloud storage users are looking for a service that provides them with a large amount of storage space, file creation and collaborative tools.</p>

          <h3>Swot Analysis</h3>
          <p>There were 3 competitive analysis conducted - Usability, cross-platform accessibility and storage were critical. Along with that the importance of an intuitive, easy to use design was strongly required. Within the cloud storage market there is a need for an application like ByteSpace, users want more storage space. Creating an application that can compete with other services by providing a competitive (larger amount of free space) will be key in the foundation of ByteSpace.</p>

                  <p>When creating the sketches keeping the users need in mind was important. Users want a place where they can easily collaborate, create content and share files/content. With that in mind, in the homepage there was a highlight on the collaboration aspects as well as testimonials and a login/sign up option. With the dashboard I wanted the user to easily be able to access, upload and view their files.</p>

                <p>High Fidelity designs were created with the user in mind, preference testing, along with user testing were conducted on multiple phases of the design process.</p>

              <p>Throughout the process there were multiple updates and changes to the ByteSpace design, with the aide of user testing, knowing what worked and didn’t helped developed ByteSpace and will continue to do so.</p>

          <p>ByteSpace as a brand illustrates technology, clarity and functionality. A motherboard was used as an inspiration. The logo was inspired by the circuitry on a motherboard.</p>

    <section class="Conclusion">
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>ByteSpace highlighted the importance of user testing and how important the user is in the design process. Creating a user survey that provides the information a designer needs to create a tool is important, with my initial survey I fail to capitalize on my initial survey questionnaire. This error lead me to create a follow-up survey to get a better understanding of what the users wanted in a cloud storage service. Having the opportunity to create a service from the beginning to the end was a tremendous learning experience, learning how the research leads to creating an entire brand, its design and its future development was a humbling experience.</p>
