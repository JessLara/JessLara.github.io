      <div class="sectionline"></div>
      <p>Online cloud storage demands are increasing on a daily basis with more people accessing the internet and requiring to store their data in a place that’s safe and accessible from anywhere. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Solution">
      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <div class="sectionline"></div>
        <p>ByteSpace will create an organized environment, also known as a space, where you can keep files and content in one quick and easy to access place. ByteSpace is a tool that will allow users to create content quickly; whether that’s a space to keep notes, or a space to share photos, everything is just a click away.</p>

      <p>Cloud and non-cloud storage user are in need of a service that will help them stay organize; they want a place where they can create content, organize their files and where they can collaborate with other users. Current cloud storage users are looking for a service that provides them with a large amount of storage space, file creation and collaborative tools.</p>

          <h3>Swot Analysis</h3>
          <div class="sectionline"></div>
          <p>There were 3 competitive analysis conducted - Usability, cross-platform accessibility and storage were critical. Along with that the importance of an intuitive, easy to use design was strongly required. Within the cloud storage market there is a need for an application like ByteSpace, users want more storage space. Creating an application that can compete with other services by providing a competitive (larger amount of free space) will be key in the foundation of ByteSpace.</p>

                  <p>When creating the sketches keeping the users need in mind was important. Users want a place where they can easily collaborate, create content and share files/content. With that in mind, in the homepage there was a highlight on the collaboration aspects as well as testimonials and a login/sign up option. With the dashboard I wanted the user to easily be able to access, upload and view their files.</p>

    <section class="Conclusion">
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <div class="sectionline"></div>
      <p>ByteSpace highlighted the importance of user testing and how important the user is in the design process. Creating a user survey that provides the information a designer needs to create a tool is important, with my initial survey I fail to capitalize on my initial survey questionnaire. This error lead me to create a follow-up survey to get a better understanding of what the users wanted in a cloud storage service. Having the opportunity to create a service from the beginning to the end was a tremendous learning experience, learning how the research leads to creating an entire brand, its design and its future development was a humbling experience.</p>
